# aboutme
Hey, my name is Richard Morgan Shaw.

I'm an aspiring programmer who's main goal is to break into the industry and figured webdev would be the best way to go. I tend to dabble in my free time by trying to code up whatever my friends what me to do and see how far I can take, so I have a decent amount of experience as far as coding goes. My family also owns two pet tortoises, a father and son, and they both so adorably tiny!
